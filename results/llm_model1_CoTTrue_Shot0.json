Words like “shunned,” “executive,” and “protesting” are not everyday language for a beginner, but are common enough for an intermediate learner.

Words like \"regarded,\" \"ecologist,\" \"shaped,\" and \"attitude\" are not typical of lower levels (A1/A2). While not highly specialized, the vocabulary extends beyond everyday conversation.\n\n**Grammar:** The grammatical structures are accurate and relatively complex. The use of the passive voice (\"is regarded\") and relative clauses (\"one of those who...\") demonstrates a good command of grammar. There are no noticeable grammatical errors.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The sentence is coherent and conveys a clear idea. It establishes a connection between White and the development of ecological thought. The sentence functions effectively as a topic sentence or a concise summary statement.\n\n**Task Achievement:** The sentence successfully communicates a specific piece of information – White’s importance as a pioneer in ecological thinking. It fulfills its purpose of conveying a factual statement.\n\nConsidering these factors, the text requires a level of vocabulary and grammatical understanding that surpasses A1/A2. It doesn't demonstrate the complexity or nuance required for C1/C2. The sentence is clear and concise, effectively conveying its meaning with accurate grammar and a moderate vocabulary range, fitting comfortably within the B2 level. It's not overly complex, but it is certainly beyond the scope of an intermediate (B1) learner.",

The grammar is accurate *as far as it goes*, but the incomplete sentence makes a full grammatical assessment difficult. The presence of a comma after July is slightly unusual but doesn't indicate a significant error.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The text attempts to convey information about temperature, but it's incomplete. There is a logical connection between the hottest month and its average temperature, but the lack of the temperature value severely hinders coherence. It feels like a fragment of a larger text.\n\n**Task Achievement:** The text *attempts* to state a fact, but its incompleteness prevents it from fully achieving this purpose. It sets up an expectation (the temperature) that isn’t fulfilled.\n\nConsidering these factors, the text demonstrates characteristics of a very basic level of language proficiency.

Grammatically, it employs a past tense narrative and uses adverbs to modify verbs, but the structures are not complex – it’s a straightforward declarative sentence. Cohesion and coherence are present in that the sentence relates a clear event with a cause (the cat’s death) and effect (her crying). However, the text is extremely concise; it doesn’t elaborate on the emotional state, the relationship between the people involved, or the context surrounding the event.

    "rationale": "The text, \"He had climbed 10 out of 14 eight - thousanders , all without supplementary oxygen,\" presents a fairly concise statement with specific, though potentially specialized, vocabulary. Let's break down the assessment:\n\n**Vocabulary:** The phrase \"eight-thousanders\" is not common everyday vocabulary; it refers specifically to mountains over 8,000 meters. \"Supplementary oxygen\" is also a relatively specialized term, although the meaning can be inferred from context. However, the remaining vocabulary (\"he,\" \"had climbed,\" \"out of,\" \"all,\" \"without\") is basic. The density of specialized terms, even if understandable in context, elevates the text beyond A1 or A2.\n\n**Grammar:** The sentence employs the past perfect tense (\"had climbed\"), which is typically introduced at the B1 level and mastered by B2. The sentence structure itself is not overly complex, but the use of the past perfect demonstrates grammatical control beyond the elementary levels. There are no grammatical errors.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The sentence is coherent and presents a clear, albeit concise, idea. The \"all\" refers back to the climbing achievement, creating a logical connection. While brief, it's a complete thought.\n\n**Task Achievement:** The sentence effectively conveys information about a significant accomplishment.\n\nConsidering these factors, the text requires a learner to understand specific vocabulary and a more complex grammatical structure (past perfect). While the sentence is short and straightforward in its overall structure, the vocabulary and grammar point towards an upper intermediate level. A B1 learner might grasp the general meaning, but fully understanding the significance of \"eight-thousanders\" and the implication of climbing without supplementary oxygen requires a higher level of proficiency. A B2 learner would be able to understand it with ease.",

There’s a slight awkwardness with the phrasing (\"the most efficient diagnosis\") which suggests a non-native speaker or a very direct, technical style.

The use of adverbs (“often”) and adjectives (“major,” “contemporary,” “fictional”) is accurate but not particularly complex. No subordinate clauses or complex verb tenses are present.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** As a single sentence, cohesion is limited. It *implies* a broader argument – that fictional narratives (presumably represented by “Bear,” likely a reference to a work of fiction) offer responses to complex issues – but doesn't explicitly develop it.

There’s accurate use of adjectives and adverbs. The sentence structure, while not complex, is grammatically correct and demonstrates an understanding of defining characteristics.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The sentence is internally coherent; it clearly defines hypereutrophic lakes by listing their characteristics.

While not exceedingly rare words, they are not typical of everyday conversation or basic texts. The vocabulary range is relatively narrow, focusing on a specific scientific topic, but the words themselves are not overly complex individually.\n\n**Grammar:** The grammatical structures are accurate but relatively complex. The sentence utilizes a participial phrase (\"induced by chemicals…\") and a coordinating conjunction (\"and\"). The passive voice (\"are usually induced\") is employed, indicating a level beyond basic sentence construction. There's a clear understanding of grammatical relationships to convey a precise meaning.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The text is coherent, presenting a clear, albeit concise, explanation of the cause of insect galls. The relationship between the insect's actions and the resulting plant abnormality is logically presented. The use of \"and possibly\" adds nuance without disrupting the flow.\n\n**Task Achievement:** The text successfully achieves its purpose – to define the cause of insect galls in a scientific manner. It’s a factual statement, demonstrating an ability to convey information accurately.\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The text requires a certain level of background knowledge to fully understand (specifically, a basic understanding of biology). The grammatical structures and vocabulary, while not exceptionally advanced, are beyond the scope of lower CEFR levels (A1, A2, or even a basic B1). The precision and conciseness suggest a reader capable of processing complex information.

Grammatically, the sentence is structurally simple (Subject-Verb-Object with modifiers) but utilizes passive voice (\"is regenerated,\" \"is recycled\"), which is more common at intermediate to upper-intermediate levels. Cohesion and coherence are limited due to the sentence’s brevity; however, within that constraint, the relationship between the actions (regeneration/recycling) and the destination (leaching step) is clear to someone familiar with the process.

While the sentences aren't excessively long or convoluted, they aren't simple either.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence:** The text presents a logical relationship between two scientific concepts, establishing a clear connection – if a material is pyroelectric, it *must* also be piezoelectric, and pyroelectricity often correlates with a stronger piezoelectric effect. The text is coherent and concise, directly stating a scientific principle.

It doesn’t exhibit the nuanced argumentation or implicit meaning found in C1 or C2 texts, nor the broader range of vocabulary and grammatical structures typical of those levels. It’s more than just stating facts in a simple way (B1); it's presenting specific biological information with a degree of precision.
