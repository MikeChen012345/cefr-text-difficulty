    "rationale": "**Rationale**\n\n- **Vocabulary:** The passage uses a limited set of words: a proper noun (“Dimethylmercury”) and common adjectives (“extremely toxic”, “dangerous”). Apart from the technical term, the lexicon is basic and does not show a wide or abstract range.\n- **Grammar:** The sentence follows a simple Subject‑Verb‑Complement pattern (“Dimethylmercury is …”). There is only one clause, no subordinate structures, and the grammar is entirely correct but elementary.\n- **Cohesion and Coherence:** As a single, stand‑alone sentence, there is no need for linking devices or complex organization. The idea is expressed directly and clearly.\n- **Task Achievement:** The sentence successfully conveys a factual statement about the substance’s hazards, which is appropriate for the communicative purpose, but it does not require higher‑level discourse skills.\n\nOverall, the text demonstrates basic vocabulary and a simple grammatical structure typical of early language proficiency. It is more advanced than the most elementary A1 level because it conveys a clear factual statement, but it does not reach the complexity required for B1.",

    "rationale": "**Vocabulary**  \nThe sentence contains several domain‑specific terms (“electrocyclic reaction”, “conrotatory”, “thermal ring‑opening”, “benzocyclobutane”). These words belong to the specialised lexicon of organic chemistry and are not part of everyday language. Recognising and understanding such terminology requires a fairly wide lexical repertoire, typical of an upper‑intermediate learner who can cope with concrete and abstract topics in a specialized field.\n\n**Grammar**  \nThe grammatical structure is simple and accurate: a noun phrase (“An example of an electrocyclic reaction”) followed by the copular verb “is” and another noun phrase (“the conrotatory thermal ring‑opening of benzocyclobutane”). No complex subordinate clauses, passive constructions, or advanced verb tenses are present, which would be expected at higher levels (C1/C2).\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence**  \nBecause the text consists of a single sentence, cohesion is limited to the internal linking of the noun phrases. The idea is presented clearly and directly; there are no discourse markers or elaborate connective devices that would be required in longer, more cohesive texts.\n\n**Task Achievement**  \nThe sentence fulfills its communicative purpose: it provides a specific example of a type of reaction. It does so succinctly and precisely, which is typical of academic or technical writing.\n\n**Overall Assessment**  \nThe combination of a simple grammatical framework with highly specialised vocabulary places the text above the elementary (A2) and intermediate (B1) levels. It aligns with the B2 description: the learner can understand the main ideas of a complex text on a concrete‑plus‑abstract, technical topic, even though the sentence itself is short. The text does not yet demand the sustained processing of longer, nuanced arguments required for C1.",

    "rationale": "The passage uses a fairly narrow but highly specialized lexical set (e.g., *fractured volcanic breccia, black dikes, igneous rock, minette, lamprophyre*). These terms are low‑frequency and typical of academic or technical discourse, which goes beyond the everyday vocabulary expected at A2 or B1.  \n\nGrammatically the sentence is simple: a passive construction (“is composed of”) followed by coordinated noun phrases and an appositive clause (“called minette, or lamprophyre”). The structure is accurate and varied enough to show control of a more complex grammatical pattern, but it does not involve subordinate clauses, conditionals, or advanced discourse markers that would be characteristic of C1/C2.  \n\nCohesion is straightforward because the text consists of a single sentence; the ideas are logically connected through coordination and the appositive, which is typical of upper‑intermediate writing.  \n\nOverall, the text demonstrates an ability to understand and produce a concise description of a technical subject using appropriate terminology and correct grammar, matching the criteria for an upper‑intermediate (B2) level.",

These words are not part of everyday everyday vocabulary and belong to a specialized, technical domain (chemistry/toxicology). The presence of such lexical items pushes the text beyond the basic‑level word stock.\n\n**Grammar**  \nThe sentence employs a modal verb (*may*) followed by a passive infinitive construction (*be used to neutralize*). This structure is typical of intermediate‑level English and demonstrates control of more complex verb patterns than simple present or past tense.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence**  \nThe text is a single, self‑contained statement that conveys a clear, concise idea. Because it is only one sentence, there is no need for larger discourse connectors, but the internal logical relation (“X may be used to Y”) is clear and correctly formed.\n\n**Task Achievement**  \nThe sentence successfully fulfills its communicative purpose: it informs the reader about a possible safety measure for a specific chemical hazard. The meaning is explicit, with no ambiguity.\n\n**Overall assessment**  \nWhile the grammatical complexity is typical of an upper‑intermediate (B2) level, the specialized vocabulary also aligns with the B2 description, which includes the ability to understand concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in one’s field.

The rest of the words (*may, be, found, in, the, environment*) are common. The presence of a specialised noun phrase pushes the lexical demand above the basic A1–A2 range, but the overall lexical load is low because the sentence is very short.\n\n**Grammar** – The structure is a simple passive construction with a modal verb (*may be found*). It is grammatically correct and uses only one clause, showing limited grammatical variety. Such a construction is typical of lower‑intermediate levels.\n\n**Cohesion and Coherence** – Because the text consists of a single sentence, there is no need for complex linking or discourse organization. The idea is expressed clearly and directly.\n\n**Task Achievement** – The sentence fulfills a simple communicative purpose: stating a factual observation about the presence of a certain type of chemical in the environment. It does so adequately.\n\n**Overall assessment** – The combination of a specialised term with otherwise simple grammar and a single‑sentence format places the text at the lower end of the intermediate band. It is more demanding than A2 because of the technical vocabulary, but it does not exhibit the range of structures or deeper abstraction required for B2 or higher.",
