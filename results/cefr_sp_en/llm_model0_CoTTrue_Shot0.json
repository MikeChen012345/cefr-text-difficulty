The vocabulary is not overly complex, but it is sufficient to convey the main idea of the text. The use of the word \"sinking\" to describe the air movement is a good example of a technical term used to describe a specific phenomenon.\n\n- Grammar: The sentence structure is simple, with a subject-verb-object word order. The use of the present tense (\"follows\") and the verb \"blowing\" suggests a general or habitual action, which is typical of expository writing. There are no apparent grammatical errors in the sentence.\n\n- Cohesion and Coherence: The text is a single sentence, and as such, it is well-organized and easy to follow. The ideas are clearly connected, and the sentence flows logically from one idea to the next.\n\n- Task Achievement: The text fulfills its communicative purpose, which is to describe the typical characteristics of a tropical wave. The sentence provides a clear and concise explanation of the phenomenon, and the use of technical vocabulary adds to the text's credibility.\n\nBased on these factors, the text appears to be written at an intermediate level, as it uses a range of relevant vocabulary and clear sentence structures to convey a specific idea.
