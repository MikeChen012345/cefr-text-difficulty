Words such as *lepidosaurian*, *pelycosaurs*, *reptilian*, and *epidermal* are technical terms from paleontology and zoology that are not part of everyday language. Understanding them requires a fairly large lexical repertoire and some background knowledge in the field. This degree of lexical specificity aligns with the CEFR description for B2, which notes the ability to understand the main ideas of complex texts on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in a particular area of specialization.\n\nCohesion and coherence are straightforward: the contrast introduced by “Unlike” clearly links the two groups being compared, and the sentence presents a single, coherent idea. There are no problems with logical flow.\n\nOverall, the sentence shows accurate grammar and clear organization, but its lexical demands are beyond the basic and elementary levels and fit the “upper‑intermediate” range described for B2.",

    "rationale": "**Rationale**\n\n- **Vocabulary:** The sentence uses a few domain‑specific terms (“hydrogen peroxide”, “lithium hydroxide”, “reaction”). These are concrete scientific nouns that are not part of everyday language, but they are single‑word lexical items rather than abstract or idiomatic expressions. Their presence raises the lexical demand above the most basic levels (A1‑A2) but does not require a broad, nuanced vocabulary.\n\n- **Grammar:** The grammatical structure is straightforward: a passive construction (“It is prepared”), a simple prepositional phrase (“by the reaction of …”), and a coordination of two noun phrases. No complex clause embedding, subordination, or advanced tense/aspect is used, which is typical of lower‑intermediate proficiency.\n\n- **Cohesion and Coherence:** The sentence is self‑contained and logically coherent; it conveys a single piece of information about how “it” is made. There is no need for linking devices beyond the preposition “by,” which is appropriate for the level.\n\n- **Task Achievement:** The text successfully fulfills its communicative purpose (describing a preparation method) in a concise manner. It does so with sufficient clarity for someone with an intermediate grasp of English.\n\nConsidering these factors, the text shows an intermediate command of English—simple grammatical forms with some specialized vocabulary—characteristic of the **B1** level on the CEFR scale.",

The structure is correct but not overly intricate; there are no subordinate clauses or advanced syntactic constructions that would push the level higher.  \n\nBecause the text is short, cohesion and coherence are not major factors, but the ideas are clearly linked through the definition‑type construction (“An example … is …”).  \n\nOverall, the passage represents a technical description that a learner would encounter in a specialized subject area.
