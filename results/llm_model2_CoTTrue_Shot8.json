However, the sentence structure is simple and declarative, which could be found at lower levels.\n\nIn terms of grammar, the text uses a basic sentence structure, with a single clause and no complex grammatical features. This simplicity suggests a lower level, but the use of a subordinate clause (\"actually\") and a noun phrase (\"an extension of the hypothalamus\") indicates some level of grammatical sophistication.\n\nThe cohesion and coherence of the text are difficult to evaluate, given its brevity, but the text does convey a clear idea about the relationship between the posterior pituitary and the hypothalamus.\n\nTask achievement is also high, as the text clearly and concisely conveys a specific piece of information.\n\nOverall, while the sentence structure is simple, the specialized vocabulary and clear task achievement suggest a higher level of language proficiency. However, the lack of complex grammatical features and the brevity of the text prevent it from reaching the highest levels.",
