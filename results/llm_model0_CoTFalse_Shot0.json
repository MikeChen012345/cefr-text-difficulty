The use of \"girlfriend\" and \"red roses\" suggests a level of familiarity with more formal or romantic expressions.\n\n- Grammar: The sentence is grammatically correct and uses a basic structure, but it's a bit more complex than a simple A1 sentence. The use of the verb \"sent\" and the phrase \"my girlfriend\" suggests a level of grammatical accuracy.\n\n- Cohesion and Coherence: The sentence is coherent and easy to follow, but it's a bit simplistic. It doesn't require much analysis or explanation.\n\n- Task Achievement: The sentence fulfills its communicative purpose, which is to express a romantic gesture, but it's a bit too straightforward for a C1 or C2 level.\n\nOverall, the text seems to be at a B1 level, which is characterized by the ability to understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters.",
