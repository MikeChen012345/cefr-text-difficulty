The sentence structure is simple, but the use of a subordinate clause (\"to examine thin tissue sections\") indicates a moderate level of grammatical complexity. The text is well-organized and effectively conveys a specific piece of information, indicating a good level of cohesion and coherence. The communicative purpose of the text is clear, and the language used is precise and concise.\n\nConsidering these factors, the text appears to be written at a level that is accessible to individuals with a good understanding of technical vocabulary and grammatical structures, but may be challenging for those without a background in biology or medicine.",
